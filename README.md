Rainbox is a collection of musical tools.

Developing in RNBO feels like a natural point to deleniate my work.
The initial work are basic modules than can be connected together in the graph editor.
These modules describe some basic operations like subtractive and sample playback.
The goal here is to answer some basic questions about RNBO's capabilities. 
Once this is established, I will start breaking out into some more interesting directions.

Warning, items in this repository are under rapid development. Expect many changes.
